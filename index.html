               <break></break>I was born in San Diego but I grew up in Spokane WA. After highschool I bounced
               around for a few years before I landed in Bellingham WA! Bellingham was my home
               for ten years and a piece of my heart will always live there. Last year I took
               a giant leap of faith and left Bellingham into the world of unknowns! I bought
               a camera and spent a year exploring life through a lens. For four months I traveled
               solo through SE Asia and met the most amazing people.

               While I was in Asia I explored lots of yoga and meditation. I spent a month living
               at an Ashram with yoga instructors from India. We only ate vegan, meditated 5-10 
               times a day and practiced Asanas twice a day. During one of my meditation sessions
               I had a revelation that I needed to move to Portland. Little did I know that this
               path would lead me to Alchemy Code lab.

               I first discovered coding last year while I was in Indonesia. I met several people in
               internet cafes who were working for American companies but living wherever they wanted.
               I knew then that this was the type of lifestyle I wanted to pursue, although at the time 
               I did not believe I was smart enough to pursue a career in coding. I spent the last year
               exploring graphic design and Photography as an option for me to become a digital nomad.
               Luckily the skills I have learned on the Adobe suites will come in handy now that I am 
               learning web and app development. I am excited to see how this course goes!
